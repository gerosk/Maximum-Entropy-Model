# Maximum-Entropy-Model
Hi, my name is Kyprianou Gerasimos from Athens Greece and i am student of Chemical Engeineering in NTUA. These files contains codes for the modelling of crystallization processes, with mechanisms Growth, Aggregation and Breakage.
These codes are my research for my diploma Thesis.
All codes are written in Python and the main method using for the solution of the ODEs express with the Method of Moments is Maximum Entropy.
To use the codes you must first install a custom module in Python, pymaxent. This is the link https://github.com/saadgroup/PyMaxEnt/blob/master/README.md.
For any futher question contact me at gerosk@hotmail.gr
