# Maximum-Entropy-Model
Hi, my name is Kyprianou Gerasimos from Athens Greece and i am student of Chemical Engeineering in NTUA. These files contains codes for the modelling of crystallization processes, with mechanisms Growth, Aggregation and Breakage.
These codes are my research for my diploma Thesis.
All codes are written in Python and the main method using for the solution of the ODEs express with the Method of Moments is Maximum Entropy.
To use the codes you must first install a custom module in Python, pymaxent.To understand the method open the link https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711019302456. This is the link of the module https://github.com/ElsevierSoftwareX/SOFTX_2019_241.
Codes that are named with Final are for solving ODEs problems with Maximum Entropy method.
Futhermore, two extra codes are provided for fitting problems using experimental Data. You cannont run them properly because of the Excel which contains the Data is private.
Although, you can see a way of fitting and you can use your own data. 
Codes are provided also in text form.
Thank you very much.
